how is the timetable generated?

minute difference between last and next (from) element is calculated
  new timetable_fill is created, rowspan=diff
minute difference between from and to is calculated
  new timetable_event element is created, rowspan=diff

both are appended to list indexed by raum id then incrementing list

later for each row for each raum id everything is printed
-> conversion is done so we can have the table in the same
